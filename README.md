# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

- I was responsible for designing a program that could create a menu, accept inputs, and output correct requested information using data structures such as trees, vectors, and hash table. Ultimately, the program needed to assist an advising program in providing accurate course information. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

- I began by reviewing the course materials and understanding the characteristics and usage of different data structures. Then, I analyzed the requirements of the project and chosen the appropriate data structures that best fit the task at hand. Understanding data structures is important because they allow for efficient and organized storage and retrieval of data, which can greatly enhance program performance.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

- I encountered roadblocks such as difficulty implementing a particular data structure or troubleshooting an error within the code. To overcome these roadblocks, I sinmply used my resources to review, step away and come back, and most times after coming back, I can see where I made a mistake. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

- Designing software and developing programs has exposed me to new data structures and showed me how to choose the appropriate data structure based on the requirements of the project. I have learned how to analyze a problem and break it down into smaller, manageable tasks and overcoming any problem solving skills.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I have evolved the way I write programs that are more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Using appropriate data structures can make code easier to read and understand, and modular design can make programs more adaptable to changes in requirements or future enhancements.
